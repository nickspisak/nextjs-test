             A large portion of the population suffers with ADHD, ADD, or general attension disorders.
            A large number of these people, with myself included, have turned away from novels
            due to their lack of accommodation. Most novels boast their long page length, their
            overly detailed descriptions, and lack of recap leads to an experience that 
            is extremely difficult to keep focus. I decided to write stories for people like myself
            who wish to read, but cannot find any writings with this focus in mind.
        </p>
        <p>Features of the stories include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Short Chapters to allow readers to read in short bursts and make progress</li>
                <li>No fluff or filler to keep the story interesting</li>
                <li>Summary button whenever needed in case the reader ever forgets what happened previously, or is coming back to the story after not reading it for awhile</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
           I started writing these stories for my own struggles with ADHD and I hope that others feeling the same way can now find reading enjoyable. Please Enjoy!
